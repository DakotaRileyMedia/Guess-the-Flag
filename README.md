# Guess the Flag
 Guess the Flag was completed as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI course from Hacking with Swift. It is the secnd project I completed in the course. The app is a game where you are asked to guess the flag of a country. the app will alert you if you were correct or wrong, and has a score function that tells you what your score is after every round.
